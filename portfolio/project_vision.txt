## Project 1 — Personal Portfolio / Resume Site

**Why start here:** A portfolio site is simple, but helps you practice Angular basics (components, routing, styling),
and gives you something you can show potential employers.

**Requirements / Features**

- A clean home page showing your name, short bio, skills, contact info.
- A “Projects” page listing out your other Angular apps (with title, short description, link, screenshot).
- A “Contact / About” page (or section) — maybe with a form (not necessarily functional) or at least a mailto link.
- Use Angular routing to navigate between pages (e.g. `/`, `/projects`, `/contact`).
- Use component-based structure: a component for header/navigation, maybe a footer, a project-card component for each project listing, etc.
- Use CSS/SCSS (or a framework like Tailwind / Bootstrap) to make it responsive and polished.
- Put the code in a GitHub repo — good practice for version control & portfolio showcase.

**What you’ll practice:** Angular CLI project setup, components, templates, styling, routing.
