## Project 2 — Task Manager / To-Do / Notes App

**Why:** This is still relatively simple but adds user interaction, state, form(s),
CRUD within the UI, and data persistence (e.g., local storage).
Many Angular learning resources list this kind of app as a beginner → intermediate project.

**Requirements / Features**

- Display a list of tasks (or notes), each with a title, description (optional), status (e.g. “todo / done”), maybe a due date.
- Ability to **create**, **edit**, **delete**, and **mark as done/undone** tasks.
- Use reactive forms (or template-driven forms) to accept user input for creating or editing a task.
- Persist data using browser local storage so tasks survive page reloads.
- Implement sorting/filtering (e.g. show only “todo”, only “done”, sort by due date, etc.).
- Optional but nice: allow toggling light/dark mode; maybe some simple animations (e.g. fade out removed task).

**What you’ll practice:** Forms, component interaction, services (for managing data), state management (in-memory + local storage),
structural directives (e.g. *ngFor, *ngIf), two-way binding / reactive forms, user interaction.

## Vision

# Routes
- '/': A simple home page
- '/users': Shows list of users
    - this should show list of existing users with option to add new user
    - add new user button should just have a pop-up form to enter user details (name, email, etc) then redirect to that users task list
- '/tasks/:uid': Tasks for specific user
    - shows list of tasks for that user
    - tasks should show preview on a sidebar and show details on main area when clicked
    - Use automatic saving when editing task details (no save button)
    - option to add new task (pop-up form)
    - each task should have options to edit, delete, mark done/undone'
    - include filtering/sorting options (use query params for this)
- '/tasks/:uid/:taskId': Specific task details
